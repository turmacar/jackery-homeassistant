**Note:** Different Jackery device models may report different combinations of DC output sensors. Some models use a combined `odc` parameter while others use separate `odcc` and `odcu` parameters. The integration hides the combined DC entity when split USB/car output keys are available.

## Supported Controls

The integration creates writable entities only when the corresponding properties are reported by the device.

| Entity             | Description                                         | Format         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Charging Plan Time | Charging plan time window for supported devices     | `HH:mm-HH:mm`  |

## Device-Specific Availability

- Entities are created only when the Jackery API reports the underlying key for that device.
- Charging plans are not available for devices connected to a Smart Transfer Switch.
- Scheduled plan entities (plan sensor and per-plan toggle switches) appear only for the Smart Transfer Switch.
- Fault diagnostic entities are created when the device reports an `fz` sub-object. Multi-state faults show human-readable labels; binary faults show Problem/OK.
- `Charging Plan` appears when the device reports DP `107`.
- `Charging Plan Time` and `Charging Plan Repeat` appear when the device reports DP `108`.
- Devices that split DC control into `odcu` and `odcc` will not show the combined `DC Output` entity.
- `Charging Plan Time` and `Charging Plan Repeat` become unavailable if the reported DP `108` payload is missing or malformed.

## Installation

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
3. Search for "Jackery" in the integrations section
4. Click "Download" and restart Home Assistant

HACS installs published version tags from GitHub releases. This repository now publishes a matching GitHub release automatically whenever a semantic version tag is pushed.

If you need fixes that have not been published as a new GitHub release yet, HACS can also install the repository's default branch. This keeps branch installs available even while the latest published release remains `1.0.4`.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `jackery` folder to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Jackery" and select it
4. Enter your Jackery account credentials:
   - **Username**: Your Jackery account email/username
   - **Password**: Your Jackery account password
5. Click **Submit**

The integration will automatically discover your Jackery devices and create the supported entities for each one.

## Usage

Once configured, you'll find your Jackery devices and their entities in:

- **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities**
- Each device will have its own set of supported entities

You can use these entities in:

- **Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards to monitor your power station
- **Automations**: Set up automations based on battery level, power status, alarms, or control states
- **Templates**: Use sensor values in templates for custom calculations
- **Controls**: Change supported Jackery settings directly from Home Assistant

### Example Automations

```yaml
# Low battery alert
automation:
  - alias: "Low Battery Alert"
    trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.jackery_device_remaining_battery
      below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Jackery battery is low: {{ states('sensor.jackery_device_remaining_battery') }}%"

  # AC output turned on notification
  - alias: "Jackery AC Output On"
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.jackery_device_ac_output
      to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Jackery AC output has been turned on"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your Jackery account credentials
   - Ensure your account is active and not locked

2. **No Devices Found**
   - Make sure your Jackery device is connected to the internet
   - Verify the device is registered to your account

3. **Sensors Not Updating**
   - Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
   - Verify your device has internet connectivity

### Logs

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.jackery: debug
```

## Requirements
