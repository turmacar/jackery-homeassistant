# Device Availability

The integration creates entities dynamically based on what properties the Jackery API reports for each device. Not all entities appear for all devices.

## General Rules

- Entities are created only when the device reports the underlying property key.
- No entities are created for properties the API does not return for a given device.
- DC output behavior differs by model: see [DC Output Variants](#dc-output-variants) below.

## Transfer Switch-Only Entities

The following entities are only created for the Smart Transfer Switch:

**Sensors:**
- Scheduled Plans, Active Plan
- Mains Power Fault, AC1/AC2 Error Codes, AC1/AC2 Temperature Alarms, Module Overload
- AC1/AC2 battery slot sensors (Battery Level, Output/Input Power, Remaining Time, Time to Full, Battery Status, Connected, Battery Packs, per-pack Battery Level)
- Per-circuit power sensors

**Binary Sensors:**
- Emergency Stop, AC1/AC2 Communication Fault, Cover Open, Temperature Fault, RTC Fault

**Switches:**
- Grid / Station, Force Charge, UPS Mode
- Per-circuit switches
- Per-plan toggle switches

**Selects:**
- Working Mode

**Numbers:**
- Backup Reserve

## Portable Device-Only Entities

The following entities are only created for portable power stations:

**Switches:**
- Charging Plan

**Text:**
- Charging Plan Time

**Selects:**
- Charging Plan Repeat

`Charging Plan` appears when the device reports DP 107. `Charging Plan Time` and `Charging Plan Repeat` appear when the device reports DP 108. These entities become unavailable if the DP 108 payload is missing or malformed.

Individual portable **Charging Plan** entities are not available for devices currently connected to a Smart Transfer Switch.

## Fault Diagnostic Entities

Fault entities (both multi-state sensors and binary sensors) are created when the device reports an `fz` sub-object in its property data. All fault entities use the diagnostic entity category.

## AC1/AC2 Battery Slot Sensors

AC1 and AC2 slot sensors appear when the Transfer Switch reports `ac1` or `ac2` sub-objects respectively.

Per-pack battery level sensors (`AC1 Pack N Battery`) appear only when a pack is physically connected. After a pack is first plugged in, it can take 24 hours or more before the sensor is created, as the device registers the pack over time.

## Circuit Entities

Circuit power sensors and on/off switches appear for Transfer Switch devices. Split-phase pairs are automatically detected and combined into single entities.

## DC Output Variants

Some Jackery models report DC output as a single combined `odc` property. Others report separate USB (`odcu`) and DC car (`odcc`) properties. When a device reports the separate properties, the combined DC Output entities (sensor and switch) are hidden and only the individual USB and car entities appear.

## UPS Mode

The UPS Mode switch and UPS Mode binary sensor are created for the Transfer Switch. UPS Mode is not available on standalone portable devices.

## Transfer Switch Connected

The Transfer Switch Connected binary sensor appears on portable devices when the `box` property is reported by the API.
